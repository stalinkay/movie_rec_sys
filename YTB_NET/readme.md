It seems training dose not converge, so it fails. -_-||

> May due to

1. Information embedding is not good, just change Id and genres to number vectors. I think it is not good, _YouTube paper_ did not give embedding detials. We could refer to this [repo](https://github.com/chengstone/movie_recommender) (we see this Friday) to see how to embed info.

2. Maybe the data set is too small to be suitable for this model. We know Google have good computer and large number of data. But our hardware, dataset and time are limited.
