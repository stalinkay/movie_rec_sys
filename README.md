## Overview:
Movie recommender systems are a crucial part of online streaming services, as they  effectively  help  users  find  videos  that  they  might  enjoy  watching.   Many deep-learning based recommendation systems have been proposed in recent years.
In this report we investigate and compare two recommender systems that utilize deep learning. We compare the performance of these models using Precision and Hit Rate.  We also implement a few non-deep learning baseline models to compare with the more complex models.  All models are run and evaluated using the Movielens 1-Million Dataset.
